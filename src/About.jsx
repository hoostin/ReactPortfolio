					<h2>More About Me</h2>
					<p>
						{" "}
						I have always loved software and technology, in general, I have
						wanted to be apart of creating them from a young age. Throughout
						high school, I was apart of both the robotics team and a game-making
						team where I got to learn programming and engineering skills. Those
						teams helped build my passion for computer science which influenced
						my career path. After college, where I learned more of the
						traditional computer science theory and lower-level systems, I
						decided to attend Thinkfulâ€™s engineering immersion program to expand
						my knowledge of modern industry standards in the software
						engineering world giving me a more comprehensive education. I am
						currently working with a group on a Startup where we are working
						together to make a modern solution to improve the process of
						parking. I currently am able to provide both frontend and backend
						support as a full-stack developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I enjoy finding better ways of solving problems and seeing how
						different people solve the same problem. I benefit from working in
						groups with other programmers that help me see different ways of
						thinking about a problem so that the best solution for the user is
						found. I would say that I am a software engineer that loves to
						constantly be learning new ways to better solve problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of web development, I am very interested in technology in
						general, especially the world of computer science. I am a pretty big
						gamer as I own an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and Gaming Pc. Outside
						of technology I love the world of sports specifically a big fan of
						both the NFL and NBA. As we start to return to a world closer to
						normal after Covid-19 my goal is to try and explore more of the
						nature here in Oregon.
