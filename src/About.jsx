					<h2>More About Me</h2>
					<p>
						{" "}
						I have always had a deep passion for software and technology. Since
						a young age, I've wanted to be involved in their creation and
						advancement. Throughout high school, I was a part of both the
						robotics team and a game-making team where I got to learn
						programming and engineering skills. Those teams helped build my
						passion for computer science, which influenced my career path. After
						college, where I learned more of the traditional computer science
						theory and lower-level systems, I decided to attend Thinkfulâ€™s
						engineering immersion program. This program helped me expand my
						knowledge of modern industry standards in the software engineering
						world, providing me with a more comprehensive education. During this
						time I was working with a group on a Startup to make a modern
						solution to improve the process of parking. Currently, I work as an
						SDK Engineer at Skillz, where my role involves enhancing a mobile
						SDK that enables game developers to create games on the Skillz
						platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						I enjoy finding better ways to solve problems and working with other
						programmers in groups to explore different perspectives. As a
						software engineer, I constantly seek to learn new methods for
						problem-solving so that the best solution for the user is found.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of web and mobile development, I am very interested in
						technology in general, especially the world of computer science. I
						am a gamer, as I own an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and a Gaming PC.
						Apart from technology, I have a deep passion for the world of
						sports, particularly being a devoted fan of both the NFL and NBA. I
						started getting into Magic: the Gathering, making some decks with my
						roomate and going to some events at my local card shop.
